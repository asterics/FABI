# Welcome to FABI

The FABI (Flexible Assistive Button Interface) allows control of a computerâ€™s mouse cursor or
keyboard by just using momentary switches. This can be helpful for people who want to create 
user interactions with the press of a button - and it allows people who can't use standard computer input devices
to play games, surf the internet, communicate and much more.

## How?

The FABI Interface can be actuated via dedicated buttons, momentary switches or self-made
electrical contacts. Additionally, a sip-puff sensor can be used to create user input.
FABI consists of a hardware module (a low-cost microcontroller which behaves
as a computer mouse and/or keyboard) and a config manager software for configuration of
the desired functions. The FABI system can be attached to computers, tablets or smart phones via USB.
Additionally, a bluetooth-module is available for devices that do not have a USB port (some Android or iOS phones).

## Folder structure of this repository
Essential information can be found in the following folders
* _Case Designs:_ different 3d-printable / lasercut designs for enclosures
* _Documentation:_ all user and construction manuals
* _FabiGUI_C#:_ the (outdated) graphical user interface (for Windows)
* _FabiWare:_ the microcontroller firmware
* _hardware:_ the KiCad design files and models for schematics and PCB layout
* _Settings:_ demo configurations which can be loaded into the FABI device via the GUI

The source of the current web based config manager can be found in another repository: [source of web based config manager](https://github.com/asterics/Addon-Bluetooth-WebGUI/tree/main/webgui)

## Configuration Manager and User manual

The FABI system does not ony offer fixed mappings of buttons to functions - it allows storing multiple configuration settings and changing them "on-the-fly". For configuration the [web-based config manager](https://fabi.asterics.eu/) should be used.
You can find information how to configure the individual button functions and system options in the user manual:

* [English user manual for configuration manager](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/UserManual/Markdown/Fabi%20User%20Manual.md) 
* [German user manual for configuration manager](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/UserManual/Markdown/Fabi%20Anwendungsanleitung.md)



## Building the hardware

There are various options for building FABI-compatible switch interfaces: you can order parts and build our construction kit, or make a completely self-driven version.
The most affordable version consists of just a microcontroller and attached momentary switches (material cost: a few bucks ...). The construction kit offers a PCB, LC-Display, 
Neopixel color led for indication of active configuration and optional modules (pressure sensor for sip/puff use, Bluetooth module for wireless access to phones/tablets etc.)
Following documentation is available for these different approaches:
* **Construction kit / PCB Version**: for building the FABI PCB Version from the construction kit.\
See [Construction kit building guide](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/ConstructionManual/PCB-Version/FABIManual.pdf)
* **DIY Building Guide - "intermediate"**: guide for creating a FABI device with a bare microcontroller and the provided 3d-printed enclosures.\
See [English version of construction manual](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/ConstructionManual/3D-printedBox/en/FABI_ConstructionManual.pdf) 
or [German version of construction manual](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/ConstructionManual/3D-printedBox/de/FABI_Bauanleitung.pdf)
* **DIY Building Guide - "all-selfmade"**: guide for creating a FABI device with a bare microcontroller and without the provided 3d-printed enclosures.\
See [DIY Building Guide](https://github.com/asterics/FABI/blob/master/Documentation/ConstructionManual/SelfmadeBox/FABI_Construction_SelfmadeBox.pdf)

## Building and Installing the Firmware

The FABI system consists of a firmware part which runs on the [Arduino Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640) microcontroller. The firmware can be updated / uploaded directly from the [Configuration Manager](https://fabi.asterics.eu/). Alternatively, you can build and upload the fimware using a recent version of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
Besides the Arduino framework, the following libraries are used und must be installed before the firmware can be compiled:

* [Light_WS2812 Neopixel library by cpldcpu](https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812) 
* [SSD1306 Oled/LCD library by Lekus2k](https://github.com/lexus2k/ssd1306) (used version: 1.8.2)

Please follow the installation instructions in the respective github repositories.


## Bluetooth AddOn

FABI supports the connection of an optional [Bluetooth Module](https://github.com/asterics/esp32_mouse_keyboard). The easiest way to use this module is to build the construction kit, 
because the PCB offers a dedicated 10-pin connector which fits the module. Pairing process and firmware update for the BT-module will be described in the user manual soon!
