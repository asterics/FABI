## Button Designs

Depending on the use case and the abilities of a user, different button constructions might be useful.

In this folder, we share different button designs, which can be 3D printed.


## Arcade Buttons

These buttons are design around arcade buttons.

**Advantages:**
* Robust
* Cheap
* Easy to order

**Disadvantages:**
* Big button cases
* Relatively high actuation force necessary

**Use cases:**
* Spasticity
* No fine motor skills

**Necessary tools:**
* 3D Printer (or ordered 3D printed parts)
* Solder iron + solder
* Wirecutter
* (insulation stripping tool)

**Necessary parts:**
* 3D printed case
* 3.5mm stereo jack plug cable, jack to jack (you just need half of it for each button): [Example cable](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000208914309.html)
* Arcade button (24 or 30mm): [24mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=24mm+arcade+button) [30mm](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=24mm+arcade+button)


## Microswitches

We designed these switches for users with very low movements and little force to actuate buttons.
At Pollin, a German electronics distributor, we found ALPS keyboard switches with 0.3N actuation force, perfect for us!

In addition, the small case is designed to hold a 2.5mm² copper wire, which is used for flexible mounting of the button, as close
as possible to the user's fingers or toes.

**Advantages:**
* Very little force necessary
* Fast printing
* Flexible mounting
* Tiny

**Disadvantages:**
* Switches are more expensive
* Not that robust
* Switches are discontinued, but replacement is available

**Use cases:**
* Little movement possible
* Narrow space for button mounting
* Little actuation force necessary

**Necessary tools:**
* 3D printer (or ordered 3D printed parts)
* Solder iron + solder
* Wirecutter
* Hot glue gun + hot glue (or euqivalent glue, e.g. epoxy)

**Necessary parts:**
* 3D printed case
* 2.5mm²/AWG13 copper wire (~30cm/12") with insulation for mounting
* 3.5mm stereo jack plug cable, jack to jack (you just need half of it for each button): [Example cable](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000208914309.html)
