These button designs are used for Arcade buttons. Depending on the ordered button diameter, please print either **button_24mm.stl** or **button_30mm.stl**.

Following parts are necessary (in addition to the 3D print):

* Arcade button (either 24mm or 30mm diameter)
* 3.5mm jack plug stereo audio cable (you can cut a plug-to-plug wire into half for 2 buttons)

After printing the case, you need to remove the built-in support material within the button.
